#Ferris Wheel CSS Animation Example
1. This code utlizes @keyframe animation to color change the cabins and make the ferris wheel spin.
2. The code is written in pure CSS.
3. The HTML utilizes span tags to create the ferrris wheel and div tags to create the cabins.
4. The CSS modifies the classes to give the physical appearance of the cabins and ferris wheel rather than creating them outright in the HTML and making the loadout time increase.
5. This code is not meant to be a full-fledged animation, but rather a simple example of how to use @keyframe animation in CSS.
